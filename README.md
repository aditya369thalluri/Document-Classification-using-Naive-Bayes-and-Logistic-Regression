Project 2

In this project we are implementing the Naive Bayes and Logistic regression document classifier and apply it to the classic 20 newsgroups dataset.

There are two Jupyter Notebook files for NaiveBayes.ipynb, LogisticRegression.ipynb stored in the folder.

Move the training.csv,testing.csv, vocabulary.txt,  newsgrouplabels.txt to the current folder of the files.

Open the Each of the Jupyter Notebooks and Run All Cells in the Cell Tab.

Each notebook outputs a CSV file. results_nb.csv file for the Naive Bayes output and results_lr.scv for logistic regression.

Also, the confusion matrix and accuracies for various hyperparamaters are plotted is printed out for both classifiers.
